# Overview

Early detection of plant diseases is crucial for maintaining the health of crops and ensuring high yield. This project aims to use machine learning techniques to identify various diseases affecting cherry plants from images of their leaves. The model can help farmers and agronomists take prompt action to protect the plants and manage diseases effectively.

# Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of images of cherry plant leaves with various diseases, as well as healthy leaves. Each image is labeled with the corresponding disease type or "healthy". The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes the following disease classes:

- Healthy
- Powdery Mildew

# Model

The model used for this project is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which is well-suited for image classification tasks. The model architecture and training parameters can be found in the cherry-health-classifier.h5 file.

# Results

After training, the model achieves the following performance metrics on the test set:

Accuracy: 98.98%

Visualizations and detailed performance reports can be found in the notebook.
